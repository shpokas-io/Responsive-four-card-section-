## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Responsive design

### What I learned

Gained knowledge of how to use media queries for responsive design. For this design, I pre-designed everything before typing any code, to count how much time I need to make such a design as this.

### Continued development

I will learn more about media queries, how they work, and for next challanges i`ll dive deep in to mobile first design, since this one was made using Dekstop first
